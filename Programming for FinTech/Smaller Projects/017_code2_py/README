Open the code2.py file you have in this directory.
You will see one function, print_triangle, along with some 
code that will call that function.

The print_triangle function has an algorithm written as comments, but 
there is no code. You should translate this algorithm to code.

After the function, there are three statements:
  - printing a message of a triangle of height 4
  - calling print_triangle to print the triangle
  - printing the total number of starts in that triangle
    (returned by the print_triangle function).

There is also a comment asking you to write a few more statements
to do the same thing for a triangle of height 7.
Add the code to do this.

Execute your code with python3 code2.py

If your program has any errors, the interpreter will do its best
to describe what is wrong. If a problem exists, look at the code 
and try to see where you did not follow the syntax rules from 
the different notebooks.  The line number and message it gives
may help you find the problem.  If you cannot find the problem 
after a few minutes, ask for help.

If your code has legal syntax, your program should run and produce
output.  Compare this output with the output we expect.

If they are the same, you should commit, push, and grade.

If they are not, you should see if you can fix the problem 
(and ask for help if you cannot).

Expected output:
Here is a triangle with height 4
*
**
***
****
That triangle had 10 total stars
Here is a triangle with height 7
*
**
***
****
*****
******
*******
That triangle had 28 total stars
