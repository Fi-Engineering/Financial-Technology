Execute the code from encrypt.py by hand, assuming the program is run as

  python3 encrypt.py 5 input.txt

Write your answer in answer.txt.

As always, run the program and diff the answer against your own to ensure 
you have the correct output.

When your answer is correct, submit answer.txt

As a side note, what this program does is perform a "Ceaser Cipher"---a very
simplistic form of encryption, which (as we will see in the next problem) is 
very easy to break.
