1. Open the provided array_max.py file and write the function:
      def array_max(array);
      """
      Finds the largest number in the list
      Ignores elements that are not an int or a float

      Args:
         array (list): list of numbers (either float or int)

      Returns:
      Largest number in the list.  None if array is empty
      or if array is not a list.
      """

2. You may not use the built-in max() as part of your solution
   You'll also find that it does not work if a list contains
   incompatible types such as ints and strings.
   It will work on ints and floats in a list as they are 
   compatible for performing comparisons and arithmetic.

3. We have provided code which will print test cases and your
   function's response for them.

4. We presented the built-in function type() in the notebook
   "Types,Values,Variables,Names".
   You can test if a variable "a" is None with
   a is None

5. Test your code.  You should get 99, -3, 425, None, None, None, 42.5
   for the 7 tests provided.

6. Submit your code.
