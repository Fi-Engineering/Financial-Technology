This will be your next programming assignment.  You will need to write
a Python script that scripts that implements the following problem: 

While the standard unit of measurement for mass is the kilogram, many 
different units exists for measuring mass (and weight). Create a function
called convert_mass that has three parameters: value - the number for the
current mass, current - the unit currently used for the mass, target the 
unit to convert the mass into. The function should return the number for 
the current mass expressed in the target unit. Use the following 
conversion tables for the possible current and target units.

Unit Name	Kilograms
Kilogram	1.0
Pound	    0.453592
Stone	    6.35029
Jin	        0.5
Seer	    1.25
Gram	    0.001
Oka	        1.2829

So that we can automatically grade programs, you must follow specific
conditions as documented here:
1. The Python file must be named "unit.py". The provided file is empty.
2. We will directly call your function and evaluate the result.
3. You must name the function "convert_mass"
4. You should not have any input/output within your unit.py file.
   We will be directly calling your function.
5. You must provide a docstring so that others can understand
   what your function does.

To test your program, you may use test.py
This file will make a few sample calls to your program.

Sample Execution
$ python3 test.py
