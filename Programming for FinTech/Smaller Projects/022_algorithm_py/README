This problem is intended to help you practice translating from handwritten 
algorithms to Python code.

Here is what you need to do:

 (1) Review your algorithm from AoP problem 1.8 [page 21]    
     (as solved during the 'algorithm' assignment)

 (2) Write a Python function, 'series18(N)' that computes and 
     prints the correct output, e.g.:
     > series18(1)
     -1 0 3
     > series18(3)
     -9 -8 -5 0 7 16 27 40 55

 (3) Test the code, make sure it works for, e.g.  N=6, N=7, and N=10.
     You can use test.py
     python3 test.py

 (4) Put your function in a file  "series18.py"

 (5) Submit "series18.py" for grading when you are complete.
