1. Create a file called max_seq.py and write the function:
   def max_seq(l):
   """
   max_seq returns a the maximum increasing contiguous subsequence in the list.
   
   Args:
   l(list): list of numbers

   Returns:
   the maxiumum increasing contiguous subsequence as a list. If the l is empty,
   an empty list is returned

   Raises:
   TypeError is the function contains an item that is not arithmetically 
   compatible with ints and floats
   """
   
   For example, if the list passed in were
   [ 1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 8, 2, 4, 6, 9]
   this function would return [1, 3, 5, 8]

2. Create a file "test_max_seq.py" that contains at least three unittest 
   test cases that test your program.  Your test class should be called
   "TestMaxSequence"

3. Submit your code for max_seq.py and test_max_seq.py

Hint:
  Can you abstract a complex step out into a simple function?
  The TypeError will occur with the right test case, you just need to
  write a test case that will cause it to be raised.
