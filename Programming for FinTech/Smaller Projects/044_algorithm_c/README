Review your algorithm from AoP problem 1.8 [page 21] (as solved during the 'algorithm' assignment)
Review your Python function for solving the AoP problem (as solved during the 'algorithm_py' assignment)
Write a C function, 'series18(int N)' that computes and prints the correct output, e.g.:
4.   
5.       > series18(1)
6.       -1 0 3
7.       > series18(3)
8.       -9 -8 -5 0 7 16 27 40 55
Use the following C main program to test your function:
10. 
11.int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
12.    if (argc < 2) {
13.        printf("N not specified\n");
14.        printf("usage: series18 N\n");
15.        return 1;
16.    }
17.    int n = atoi(argv[1]);
18.    series18(n);
19.    return 0;
20.}
Test the code, make sure it works for, e.g.  N=6, N=7, and N=10.
Put your function and the main program in a file "series18.c". Add it to git, commit, push, and request grading.
