Write the functionality for the compute_average function
defined in compute_list_avg.py
We have provided the method docstring which describes the behavior the
function needs to implement.

We have created a unittest module in test_compute_list.py   
You can run the tests in this file with -

  python -m unittest test_compute_list.py 


Once your compute_average function passes the test cases, 
submit your work for grading.
