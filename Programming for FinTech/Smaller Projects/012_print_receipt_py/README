This will be your next programming assignment.  You will need to write
a Python script that scripts that implements the following problem: 

Write a function with the following declaration - 
def print_receipt(subtotal, tax_rate, tip_rate):

That prints the following:
 Subtotal: $     10.00
      Tax: $      0.50
      Tip: $      2.00
            ==========
    Total: $     12.50
with the call: print_receipt(10.00, .05, .2)
Use formatting for all of the numbers and equal signs.

So that we can automatically grade programs, you must follow specific
conditions as documented here:
1. The Python file must be named "print_bill.py". The provided file only
   has the function declaration.
2. We will directly call your function and evaluate the result.
3. You should not have any input/output within your print_bill.py file.
   We will be directly calling your function.
4. You must provide a docstring so that others can understand
   what your function does.

To test your program, you may use test.py
This file will make a few sample calls to your function.

Sample Execution
$ python3 test.py
Subtotal: $     10.00
     Tax: $      0.50
     Tip: $      2.00
           ==========
   Total: $     12.50
