This will be your next programming assignment.  You will need to write
a Python script that contains a function "my_max" that determines
which of the two parameters is larger and returns that parameter as
the result.  

Python does have a built-in function max().  You may not use that function
as part of your answer.

In my_max, the algorithm is written as a docstring, but there is no code.
You should translate this algorithm to code.

In main, there are three print statements which call max and print
its result.  These would let you check if max is working right.

There is also a comment asking you to write one more print statement
with a call to max.  In that comment, it asks you to take the max
of two numbers (written as hex), and print them out.
Add a line of code to do this.

On this platform, you can execute your program with

python3 code.py

Sample Execution:
$ python3 code.py
max(42, -69): 42
max(33, 0): 33
max(0x123456, 123456): 1193046
max(0x451215AF, 0x913591AF): 2436207023

If your output matches the above sample, you should commit, push, and grade.

If they are not, you should see if you can fix the problem (and ask for help
if you cannot).
