This will be your first programming assignment.  You will need to write
a Python script that scripts that implements Exercise #3 from the
notebook "05-BasicInputAndOutput": 

Write a program to determine the monthly payment for a 30 year mortgage 
for an initial principal amount and interest rate that the user specifies.
The formula (as presented in the notebook) is also available at
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan#Principal_and_interest

You need to compute periodic amortization payment assuming 12 payments
per year.

So that we can automatically grade programs, you must follow specific
conditions as documented here:
1. The Python file must be named "mortgage.py".  We have provided an
   initial template for this file.
2. You will need to replace the "..." with lines of code to perform
   any necessary conversions and calculations.
3. You may change variable names.  However, the intention of the line
   payment_amount = int(A*100)/100 
   is to convert the answer to whole cents (as an integer). Then
   to divide by 100 to take the answer back to dollars in a float value.
   In a few notebooks, we'll show how to use string formatting instead.
4. The final line should simply print the number. 
5. You may assume that we will provide valid input (positive numbers)

On this platform, you can execute your program with

python3 mortgage.py
