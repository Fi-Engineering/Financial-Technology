In this assignment, you will write another retirement calculator, in which
your portfolio consists of investments in equities, bonds, or a combination.
Your program will read historical data, calculate rates of return, and output
the cumulative investment for each of three investment strategies to a file. 

For each portfolio option, your program should calculate the cumulative 
investment each month. We will assume the monthly deposit begins at 100.00 
and increases by 2.5% each new year (in January). 

Generally, the cumulative investment is calculated as follows: 
new balance = previous balance + 
              the interest it earns based on that month's rate of return +
              the monthly contribution. 
              
The rate of return will depend on the investment strategy, as described
in the  portfolio options below. 

Implementation Hints:
- Ensure you use the correct units. Percentages need to be converted
  to their decimal form (i.e., divide by 100)
- When you see XXXX(t) where XXXX is some field, you can think of that as 
  the current value / record.  For XXXX(t-1), that is the previous record
- think about how to express the formulas for the rate of return as
  variables - this is part of the "generalize" step
- Look to make your solution as robust as possible -> you should validate
  the input validate and catch any errors that may occur.

Portfolio Strategy 1: Invest in Equities
----------------------------------------
For this investment strategy, the cumulative portfolio and the monthly
contributions will all be invested in the S&P 500 index. For the S&P
500 investment, the rate of return (ROR) is calculated as follows:

    Portfolio ROR(t) = S&P ROR(t) + Div ROR(t), where
    S&P ROR(t) = S&P(t) / S&P(t-1) – 1 
    Div ROR(t) = [Div(t) / 12] / S&P(t),

    where (t) indicates the value at that time, and (t-1) indicates the
    value the previous month. 

As an example, if the index level of a particular month is 103.30, the
previous month was 99.17, and the dividend is 3.07, then the S&P ROR is
    103.30 / 99.17 - 1 = 4.16%,
the dividend ROR is
    [3.07 / 12] / 103.30 = 0.25%,
and the total ROR is 4.41%. 

So if the previous balance was 0.00, and the monthly contribution is
100.00, then the new balance is 
    0.00  + 0.00 * ( 0.0441) + 100.00 = 100.00, which simplifies to 
    0.00  * (1 + 0.0441) + 100.00 = 100.00

If the next month's total ROR is 2.08%, then the new balance is
    100.00 + 100.00 * (0.0208) + 100.00 = 202.08, which simplifies to
    100.00 * (1 + 0.0208) + 100.00 = 202.08. 

Portfolio Strategy 2: Invest in Bonds
-------------------------------------
For this investment strategy, the monthly contribution will be
invested in US government bonds. For the US bond investment, the
(monthly) rate of return is calculated as follows:

    Bond ROR(t) = Bond(t) / 12

Note: this is a simplification that ignores the semiannual compounding
of interest for bonds, but this will have minimal impact on the
numerical result. 

As an example, if the (yearly) bond rate of a particular month is 5.95%, 
then the (monthly) bond ROR is
    5.95% / 12 = 0.50%, 

So if the previous balance was 0.00, and the monthly contribution is
100.00, then the new balance is
    0.00 + 0.00 * (0.0050) + 100.00 = 100.00, which simplifies to
    0.00 * (1 + 0.0050) + 100.00 = 100.00. 

If the next month's ROR is 0.51%, then the new balance is
   100.00 + 100.00 * ( 0.0051) + 100.00 = 200.51, which simplifies to 
   100.00 * (1 + 0.0051) + 100.00 = 200.51. 

Portfolio Strategy 3: "Lifecycle" Investment
--------------------------------------------
For this investment strategy, each month, you will invest the monthly
contribution in a combination of the S&P 500 and US government
bonds. The strategy assumes that the investor is comfortable with a
more volatile equity portfolio early in her working life because the
expected returns are higher over the long run. But she wants to shift
the portfolio gradually into more stable bonds as she gets closer to
retirement. Here, we will assume the investor begins the lifecycle
allocation for equities at 100% and decreases this by 2% each year (in
January).

Each month, the new balance is calculated as the previous balance in
equities, plus interest from equities, plus the previous balance in
bonds, plus the interest from bonds, plus the monthly
contribution. That is, 

Cumulative invest(t) =  Cumulative invest(t-1) * [1 + S&P ROR(t)] * lifecycle allocation(t) +
                        Cumulative invest(t-1) * [1 + Bond ROR(t)] * [1 - lifecycle allocation(t)] + 
                        Deposit(t),

where S&P ROR is the total ROR from this investment.

As an example, if the S&P ROR is 4.41%, the bond ROR is 0.50%, the
previous balance was 0.00, the lifecycle allocation is 100%, and the
monthly contribution is 100.00, then the new balance is 
0.00 * (1 + 0.0441) * 100% + 0.00 * (1 + 0.0050) * (1 – 100%) + 100.00
= 100.00.

The next year, the lifecycle allocation decreases to 98%, so (assuming
that the portfolio is worth 1309.33 at the end of the first year) the
calculation would be: 
1309.33 * (1 + 0.0099) * 98% + 1309.33 * (1 + 0.0054) * (1 - 98%) +
102.50
= 1424.65.

Technical instructions
----------------------
Your program will take four command line arguments: the name of a file
from which to read the S&P 500 index levels, the name of a file from
which to read US government bond rates, the date the portfolio starts,
and the date the portfolio ends. Dates will represent the year and
month with the year before a decimal point, and the month as an
integer (01-12) after the decimal point, such that 1971.12 is December
1971, and 2017.01 is January 2017. 

Your program should read the historical data from each file and
calculate the rates of return for the S&P 500 and for US
bonds. No restrictions exist on how you may represent the data in your
program.

Next, your program should do the portfolio calculations for each
investment strategy. Look for opportunities for abstraction here! 

Finally, write the results to a file "portfolio.csv", where each line
is the date followed by the three investment strategies' cumulative
investments at that date, separated by commas. You should start
the file with this header row "Date,StrategyOne,StrategyTwo,StrategyThree".
Providing others clear ideas on what is in a file is important.

Your Python file must be named "retirement.py"

For example, if you execute the program as
   python3 retirement.py sp_data.csv bond_data.csv 1971.12 2017.12

it should produce identical output to that found in example.csv.

Look to see how you can reduce code duplication by abstracting
duplicated code into a function.  Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

Testing
-------
We provide a pregrader that will run your tests against our reference
implementation. Before the deadline, when you do 'grade', the
pregrader will validate your current retirement.py implementation

While we check for some validation issues in the pregrader, the
final grader will be more exhaustive to see how well you have handled
a multitude of different issues. 

If you find an error (bad data, missing records, missing command-line
arguments, etc.), you should stop print an error message and then exit
with one of these three status codes:
  1: Issue with command-line arguments
  2: Issue with the S&P data file
  3: Issue with the Bonds data file

You are free to make your own unittest cases as well as data files.


Submission
----------
When you are satisfied with your testing, commit, push, and submit your 
assignment for grading.

Don't try to complete all of this at once.  Get small pieces of the 
code working and validated, then continue to add more functionality.

This assignment will not be graded instantly.  It will be graded ONCE
after the deadline (which is a hard deadline).
